 * Derived state is state that is calculated based on other piece of state in

 *
 * Derived state can have one of two types:
 * - Function which takes the application state and libraries as arguments. The
 *   final state is calculated by invoking that function.
 * - A curried function, which takes takes the application state and libraries
 *   as arguments and returns a function that takes any number of parameters.
 *   That function works like a "getter" for a piece of state.
